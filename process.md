# The Rundown

---
### Objective
Create a computer vision model to detect the ball in the minigame "Genji Ball",
use this alongside some more scripting to track and deflect the ball once it comes close enough.

### Ideas
- The velocity of the ball could be calculated and used to time the deflect
- The ball could be identified alongside its tail to determine direction (2 parts)
- Probably could be done with OpenCV, some fake controller input, and like PyTorch?

### Todo

- [ ] Create dataset ? Somehow? I guess videos of us standing still in genjiball lol
- [ ] Create thing to detect ball as efficiently as possible (low res / min refresh rate)
- [ ] Create numpy script to about estimate the block time 
- [ ] Trial the script in game standing still with camera locked
- [ ] Create ball cam üçÜ
- [ ] Test standing still

Idk from here

I wonder if I can put a jamboard in here or if those are only on cloud
